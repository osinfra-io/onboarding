# GitHub Organization Projects V2 - Not yet supported in Terraform provider
# GitHub has deprecated classic Projects (v1) in favor of Projects V2 (beta)
# The Terraform GitHub provider doesn't yet have full support for Projects V2
#
# Manual creation steps for now:
# 1. Go to https://github.com/orgs/osinfra-io/projects
# 2. Create new project for each team:
#    - Name: {team.display_name} (e.g., "Onboarding")
#    - Description: "{display_name} is a {team_type} {description}. This project tracks work, features, and initiatives for the {display_name} team."
# 3. Add team access via project Settings â†’ Manage access
