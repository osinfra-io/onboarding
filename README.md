## üìÑ Repository Description

This repository provides Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automation for onboarding teams across multiple platforms using OpenTofu. It implements Team Topologies principles to create a structured organizational hierarchy with appropriate access controls and tooling integrations.

The module automates the creation of:

- **Google Cloud folder hierarchy** following Team Topologies (Platform Teams, Stream-aligned Teams, etc.)
- **Google Cloud Identity Groups** with role-based access (admin, writer, reader)
- **GitHub Teams** with hierarchical structure and environment-specific approval workflows
- **Datadog Teams** for monitoring and observability

This enables platform teams to quickly onboard new teams with consistent security, governance, and operational practices across sandbox, non-production, and production environments.

Our focus is on the core fundamental practice of platform engineering, Infrastructure as Code.

>Open Source Infrastructure (as Code) is a development model for infrastructure that focuses on open collaboration and applying relative lessons learned from software development practices that organizations can use internally at scale. - [Open Source Infrastructure (as Code)](https://www.osinfra.io)

To avoid slowing down stream-aligned teams, we want to open up the possibility for contributions. The Open Source Infrastructure (as Code) model allows team members external to the platform team to contribute with only a slight increase in cognitive load. This section is for developers who want to contribute to this repository, describing the tools used, the skills, and the knowledge required, along with OpenTofu documentation.

See the [documentation](https://docs.osinfra.io/fundamentals/development-setup) for setting up a development environment.

## Architecture

The module creates a three-level folder hierarchy following Team Topologies principles:

```text
Top Level Folder (provided)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Platform Teams/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Onboarding/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sandbox/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Non-production/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Production/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Kubernetes/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sandbox/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Non-production/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Production/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Stream-aligned Teams/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Customer Trust/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sandbox/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Non-production/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Production/
```

Additionally, it creates:

- **Google Cloud Identity Groups** with 3 standard roles per team (admin, writer, reader) applied at team folder level
- **GitHub Teams** with hierarchical structure (parent team with child teams for approvers and administrators)
- **Datadog Teams** for monitoring and observability with admin/member roles, one per top-level team

## Team Structure

### Team Types (Team Topologies)

Each team must specify one of four team types:

- **`platform-team`** - Provides internal services to accelerate stream-aligned teams
- **`stream-aligned-team`** - Aligned to business capabilities/customer value streams
- **`complicated-subsystem-team`** - Focus on specific technical domains requiring deep expertise
- **`enabling-team`** - Help stream-aligned teams overcome obstacles and develop capabilities

### Environments

Each team automatically gets three hardcoded environment folders (no customization needed):

- **Hardcoded environments**: `Sandbox`, `Non-production`, `Production` (automatically created for every team)

### Google Identity Groups

Each team has exactly 3 Google Cloud identity groups using basic IAM roles applied at the team folder level:

- **`managers`**: Users who can manage the group
- **`members`**: Regular members of the group
- **`owners`**: Users who own the group
- **Hardcoded roles**: admin, writer, reader (automatically assigned)

**Auto-generated fields:**

- **`description`**: Uses official Google Cloud role descriptions (e.g., "All of the permissions in the Writer role, plus permissions for actions like...")
- **`display_name`**: `"{Team Type}: {Team Name} {Role}"` (e.g., "Platform Team: Onboarding Admin")

**Access Scope**: Groups have access to the entire team folder and all child environment folders.

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Child teams are nested under parent teams
- **Membership**: Parent teams automatically include all child team maintainers as members

### GitHub Team Structure

Each team has a hierarchical GitHub team structure with parent and child teams:

**Parent Team Configuration (`github_parent_team`):**

- **`maintainers`**: Users with full administrative access to the parent team
- **`members`**: Users with member access to the parent team

**Child Team Configuration (`github_child_teams`):**

- **`sandbox-approver`**: Members who can approve sandbox environment changes
- **`non-production-approver`**: Members who can approve Non-production environment changes
- **`production-approver`**: Members who can approve production environment changes
- **`repository-administrators`**: Repository administrators with full access

**Membership Logic:**

- **Parent Team**: Gets configured maintainers/members PLUS child team maintainers (auto-inherited as members)
- **Child Teams**: Independently configured maintainers and members
- **Deduplication**: Users configured directly on parent team take precedence over auto-inherited membership

## Resources Created

### Folder Hierarchy

- **Team Type folders**: One per team type (Platform Teams, Stream-aligned Teams, etc.)
- **Team folders**: One per team under the appropriate team type folder
- **Environment folders**: One per environment under each team folder

### Google Cloud Identity Groups

- **Google Cloud Identity Groups**: Exactly 3 per team (admin, writer, reader)

- **Example email**: `pt-onboarding-admin@osinfra.io`

### GitHub Teams

- **Parent Teams**: One per team (e.g., `pt-onboarding`, `st-customer-trust`)
- **Child Teams**: Four per team (sandbox-approver, non-production-approver, production-approver, repository-administrators)
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Child teams are nested under parent teams
- **Membership**: Parent teams automatically include all child team maintainers as members
